# POC

## Steps

- Generate a QRCode
- Convert the QRCode image into 3D
- Group cubes that structure the 3D QRCode
- Import STL file and use the converted QRCode with it
- Export the scene

## TODO

- Add controls for the generated QRCode to add position, scaling and eventually color to it
- Place the model on the center of the camera so that OrbitControls can rotate naturally
